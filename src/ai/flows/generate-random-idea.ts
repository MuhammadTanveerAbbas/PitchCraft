  prompt: `You are a creative muse for entrepreneurs, with a knack for spotting unsaturated markets and unique problems.
  Generate a single, unique, and interesting startup idea consisting of a name and a one sentence core problem it solves.
  The idea should be fresh and not a clichÃ©. Think of underserved niches or surprising applications of technology. Avoid generic names.

  RULES:
  - Do not use hyphens or em dashes.
  - The name should be memorable and hint at the solution.
  - The core problem must be specific and relatable to a clear audience.
  
  Good Examples:
  - Name: "ArchiveOS", Core Problem: "Families struggle to preserve and privately share their most important digital memories and documents across generations."
  - Name: "Localvore Connect", Core Problem: "It's difficult for consumers to discover and purchase fresh produce directly from local farms, creating a gap in the farm to table movement."
  - Name: "CodeMentor", Core Problem: "Junior developers lack personalized, on demand guidance when they get stuck on complex coding problems, slowing down their growth and project timelines."
  
  Bad Examples:
  - Name: "Cloudify", Core Problem: "Making things better with the cloud."
  - Name: "Socially", Core Problem: "A new social network for people."
