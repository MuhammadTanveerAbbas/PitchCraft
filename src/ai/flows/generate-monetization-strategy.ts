**Core Problem:** {{{coreProblem}}}

Generate the monetization strategy based on a deep, expert analysis. Be critical. Be predictive. Tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear.

RULES:
- Do not use hyphens or em dashes. Use commas and clear language.
- All outputs must be direct, concise, and professional. No buzzwords, no fluff, no sugarcoating.
- Think about second and third order consequences. Predict market reaction and potential pitfalls.

Your output must be a JSON object with the following structure:
- **monetizationStrategy**: A single, robust monetization model. How will this make money? Justify your choice with market data or behavioral economics principles. Explain why other models are wrong.
